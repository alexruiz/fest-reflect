Provides a &quot;fluent&quot; API that
makes usage of the Java Reflection API to help achieve some common case scenarios when setting/retrieving state of the objects in tests.
</p>
<p>
Here are some examples:
<pre>
    // import static org.fest.reflect.simple.SimpleReflection.*;
 
    // Retrieves the value of the field "logger" from object userService
    UserService userService = ...
    Logger logger = SimpleReflection.get(Logger.class).from(userService);
    
    // Sets the value of the field 'logger' to "Yoda"
    UserService userService = ...
    Logger logger = ...
    Logger logger = SimpleReflection.set(logger).to(userService);
</pre>
</p>
