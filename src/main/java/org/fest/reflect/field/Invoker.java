   * 
   * <pre>
   * Be aware:

   * </pre>
   * 
   * *
   * 
   * <pre>
   * Example: 
   *  I.) Assuming we have the following scenario:
   * 
   * interface IUploadFileService { 
   *    boolean upload(String file, String destination); 
   * }
   * 
   * public class FileManager {

   * }
   *    II.) Say we want to decorate the uploadFileService.upload(...) part, so that additional functionality is executed
   * <i>before</i> the actual uploadFileService.upload(...) logic. The following code will do the job:
   *
   *  IUploadFileService uploadFileServiceDecorator = ...; 
   *  
   *  FileManager fileManager = new FileManager();
   *  
   *  field("uploadFileService").ofType(IUploadFileService.class).in(fileManager).preDecoratedWith(uploadFileServiceDecorator);
   * 
   *   However, if there is an exception when calling uploadFileServiceDecorator.upload(fileName, DEFAULT_DESTINATION) the default 
   * program's flow will be interrupted and the uploadFileService.upload(fileName, DEFAULT_DESTINATION) will not be executed.
   *

   * @return a reference to customizing the decorator's behavior
